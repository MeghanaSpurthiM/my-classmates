# Project Description #
This is a simple client-side application created with ReactJS and Bootstrap.
The idea is to read from a collection of user records where for each user, 3 attributes are stored:

. name
. Favorite Color
. Favorite Food

The goal is to design a Single-Page Application where each user record is displayed in a card UI element that contains a button to like. The application keeps track of the number of times the like button is clicked - the counter is incremented after every click!

# Third-party help #
I referred to the following websites to help me build this application:

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart
https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-setstate/
https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components/cards/

I used ChatGPT to help me 

- layout the pipeline to figure out step-by-step instructions (but I wrote the code by myself)
- to resolve dependency errors

# Where is the code situated? #
src/App.js

# How to run this project locally? #
Assuming you installed the node dependencies,
